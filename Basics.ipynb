    "# Baseball Game Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and design a normalized database schema using a file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet. This project uses the following skills:\n",
    " - importing CSV data into a database\n",
    " - designing a normalized schema for a large, predominantly single table dataset\n",
    " - creating tables that match a schema design\n",
    " - migrating data from unnormalized tables into normalized tables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main files used here:\n",
    " - `game_log.csv` was produced by combining 12 separate csv files from Retrosheet\n",
    " - `park_codes.csv`\n",
    " - `person_codes.csv`\n",
    " - `team_codes.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the file `game_log_fields.txt` explains the fields included in the main file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the main game log file is so large, we'll begin by setting pandas so that the DataFrame isn't truncated."

    "The Western League was founded in 1893, and its aggressive leader Ban Johnson sought to knock the National League from its position of dominance. In 1900, the league changed its name to the American League, and in 1901, it declared the intent to operate as a major league. \n",
    "\n",
    "As baseball transitioned into a professional and fully organized sport, many rival leagues sprung up and then disappeared. The most successful rival league was the American Association (1881–1891), which allowed the sale of alcohol at games and is therefore sometimes referred to as the \"beer and whiskey league.\" Two leagues lasted for only a single season but are still considered major leagues by historians due to their high caliber of players and play: the Union Association (1884) and the Players' League (1890). As hinted at by their names, these leagues were attempts to return to player-controlled leagues that did not enforce the hated reserve clause. This clause stated that players could not freely move to other teams without the consent of the team manager.\n",

    "In yet another attempt to escape the reserve clause, the Federal League was founded in 1913 and operated as a major league in 1914-1915. The Federal League was the last independent league to play on a major league baseball field. "

    "\n",
    "To add the data currently in csv format to a normalized database, we need a single column that can be used as the primary key. However, the game log file does not contain a single column that can be used to uniquely identify each game. We have three options for handling this issue:\n",
    "1. Make a compound primary key from the existing columns.\n",
    "2. Create a new column with integer primary keys (1, 2, etc.)\n",
    "3. Create a new column with a custom format primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're just starting to create the database, it's best to not create a compound key as this could get complicated when we start to join to other tables. Reading through Retrosheet's website, they have a [data dictionary](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm) for their files that includes the following unique identifier for games:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each game begins with a twelve character ID record which identifies the date, home team, and number of the game. For example, ATL198304080 should be read as follows. The first three characters identify the home team (the Braves). The next four are the year (1983). The next two are the month (April) using the standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). The last digit indicates if this is a single game (0), first game (1) or second game (2) if more than one game is played during a day, usually a double header The id record starts the description of a game thus ending the description of the preceding game in the file.\n",

    "Now, we need to import the data into SQLite. We have three options for importing this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using the Python SQLite library**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this method, first use csv reader to get the data into Python. Next, use the [`Cursor.execute()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute) to create a table. Then, use the `Cursor.executemany()` to insert multiple rows of data in a single command. To prevent [SQL injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Incorrect_type_handling) and maintain correct data types, we should use the `?` placeholder syntax instead of Python string formatting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that it offers the highest level of control over what's happening. In addition, for larger datasets, we can write a loop that iterates over the csv data line by line so that it isn't all read into memory at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of this method is that is requires a lot of manual data handling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library contains a useful [to_sql() method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html) that can send the contents of a dataframe to a SQLite connection object. To create the table, either we can use the `execute()` method above or pandas will create it for us. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataframe.to_sql('table_name', sqlite_connection_object, index=False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* We set `index=False` so that pandas doesn't create an extra column for the pandas index. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that can be accomplished in only one or two lines of code, as shown above. However, the disadvantage is that pandas may alter the data as it reads it in and converts the column types automatically. In addition, the dataset must be small enough to be stored in memory using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. From the SQLite shell**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the SQLite shell to import the csv data:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sqlite> .mode csv\n",
    "sqlite> .import filename.csv table_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of this method are that it's fast and that it works well with large data sources. However, this method also has some disadvantages. First, SQLite determines the column types based on the first row of data, which can lead to incorrect types. Second, this method requires SQLite shell access, which isn't always available. Third, if you to create the table yourself, the header needs to be removed from the first line of the csv file; otherwise, SQLite will make the header line the first row of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since we've already read the data into DataFrames, we'll use the pandas method. The type conversion issue isn't a concern here since we plan to move the data into new tables as we move through the normalization process."
